All code was ran on Google Colab notebooks. Unfortunately I was unable to create a working product 
and only got so far as to train my model. A short description of the artifacts I have produced are written below. 

model_training.ipynb 				- Defining and training my model. Experimenting with different network structures

CLIP_embedding_generation.ipynb 		- Feature engineering performed on RefCOCO dataset using OpenAi's CLIP model

sample_creation_from_embeddingsI.ipynb		- These two files were used to create training samples for the model
sample_creation_from_embeddingsII.ipynb

surveillance_vid_parser.ipynb			- The preliminary work I have completed in attempts to create a working product
